# Test: Complete Notepad workflow with proof
# Success = proof provided + Notepad closed
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Windows 10/11
# - Windows MCP Server executable in examples folder
# - Azure OpenAI resource with Entra ID authentication configured
# - One of the following authentication methods:
#   * Azure CLI logged in (az login)
#   * Environment variables: AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
#   * Managed Identity (when running in Azure)
#   * Visual Studio Code Azure Account extension
# - Environment variables set:
#   - AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT: Azure OpenAI endpoint
#
# Run command:
#   agent-benchmark -f examples/windows-mcp-notepad.yaml -reportType html,json

criteria:
  success_rate: 1 # 100%

# Use TEST_DIR for portable paths - no hardcoded paths needed
